# DataPLANT

These templates should always try to solve one user story.

For example solve one endpoint repository and experimental setup. If you want to support more endpoint repositories for the same experiment it is best to create a new template.

Handle the naming of your template accordingly. It should be concise and descriptive, like: `GEO_plant_growth.xlsx`.

Feel free to suggest a folder structure to organize these files. All subfolder should contain a README.md with a short description/background :books:.

Any folder structure with links should be updated here:

Example for now:

- [:file_folder: GEO]()
- [:file_folder: PRIDE]()
