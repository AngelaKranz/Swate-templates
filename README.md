- in ISA-tab format
- built on ARC
- ontology linked and annotated using SWATE 


# Naming convention

1SPL  
  - Describes **sampling** of the bio source material (e.g. plant, algae, cyano)  
  - Typically "alive to freezer" metadata provided by lab experimenter  

2EXT
  - Describes the steps between sampling and actual assay  
  - Typically an **extraction**, i.e. from "freezer to extract" metadata provided by lab experimenter  

3ASY
  - Describes the (data-producing) **assay** 
  - Typically "extract to data" metadata provided by a facility (e.g. metabolomics, transcriptomics) 

4COM
  - Describes the **computational** steps 
  - Typically "data to processed data" metadata provided by either facility or computational biologist
